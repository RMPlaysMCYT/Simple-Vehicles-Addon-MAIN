# Simple-Vehicles-Addon-MAIN
Welcome to this GitHub Repository where you can check any of stuffs that I previously made but I'll try to make this open without ads so that you can support it here thank you

# Information
This add-on add up to 110 vehicles in Minecraft and this is my biggest add-on that I ever made it for you and to everyone who love vehicles add-on and this could be suitable to City maps and role play maps

History
I made this add-on since March 2019 and I do an upload online but I'm not good enough to make add-ons here before then now I have an good potential in making mods so I continue to working in this mod and I did it

And did you know that I like making Vehicles too that can be found in local or not but some models are made by me anyway and this addon is now for over 4 years and it's still working on new updates

NOTE: THIS CONTENT IS ONLY EXCLUSIVE ON MCPEDL NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO USING OWN LINKS ON THIER VIDEOS AS I SEE AND I'LL REPORT YOU IF YOU VIOLATE IT!!!
This is the only addon that's has over 100+ Vehicles to try
This addon has lots of items that are craftable in survival
This addon was compatible in servers and it can be playable with friends or by yourself
Most of the vehicles are based in real life and other vehicles are based from my ideas
This vehicle addon has more features to come
It cares the community and even the ideas from you we will love it
This addon is showcased by many people on YouTube and Other Social Media platforms
And I'm gonna try to rewrite some stuff here especially the mechanics were been improved and added some new stuff and more

Vehicles
I made over 100 vehicles and I still try to improve it as long as I can and I hope you may appreciated it

Items
 Here are some item parts work well







And here's more stuff to see











You must create an vehicle workbench to access this stuff


Vehicle Builder is also required to make your vehicle parts turn into one vehicle


Hint: The body + The tire of a vehicle = One Vehicle
There are crafting stuff that you can try and all you had to do to create this items was to set your gameplay in survival mode




Not all Items are available on survival and I'll have a chance to add it in the future
New Places Added:

2. Houses
